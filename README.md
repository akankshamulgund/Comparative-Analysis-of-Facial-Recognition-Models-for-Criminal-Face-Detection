# Comparative-Analysis-of-Facial-Recognition-Models-for-Criminal-Face-Detection
This project analyzes facial recognition models (MTCNN-FaceNet-KNN, MTCNN-FaceNet-SVM, LBPH-HaarCascade) for criminal face detection.

The project aims to conduct a comparative analysis of facial recognition models tailored for criminal face detection. The selection among MTCNN-FaceNet-KNN, MTCNN-FaceNet-SVM, and LBPH-HaarCascade hinges on unique project prerequisites. When prioritizing exceptional accuracy and having computational resources at disposal, the MTCNN-FaceNet-KNN or MTCNN-FaceNet-SVM pathways prove advantageous. Conversely, if the project necessitates swift, resource-efficient face detection for fundamental tasks, LBPH-HaarCascade emerges as a compelling alternative.
